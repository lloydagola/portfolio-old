## about the client

Even before the global Covid19 pandemic occurred, getting access to high quality medical care in the third world was a tall order. Most Kenyans were simply unable
to affor medical bills within their own country; it can be so expensive that it often makes more financial sense to travel abroad for medical procedures. IMT is 
a start up that aims to solve this problem by pioneering inclusive policies.

> Access to medical care should be a right.
> We aim to increase healthcare inclusivity by helping to make it cheaper for all citizens to access medical care

The client prides himself in having a unique eye for design. He thus required a design that would not only help his brand stand out, but also communicate that 
the organization was extremely professional. After mocking up a number of designs, we settled on a minimalism theme with a lot of white backgrounds to evoke a sense of trust
, responsibility and professionalism; and of course beauty. Purple highlights serve to break monotony and link the various elements.

## Challenges faced in this project 

For this project, a lot of research went into the psychology of design before I even touched a single line of code. This would have to be the most professional 
website I designed as it was relating to the health of people who might be in difficult situations. A lot of the users would be focused on bigger issues and therefore may be put off by flashy/fancy animations which might seem pretentious - those had to be used with exreme restraint. Hope was therefore, the central subject of the design. Purple seemed
like a nice choice for hopeful emotions, yellow is a perfect color for calmness and white for purity.
